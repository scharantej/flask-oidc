 The TRTD problem is a challenging problem in the field of machine learning. It involves training a model to predict the toxicity of a given chemical compound. This is a difficult task, as there are many factors that can contribute to the toxicity of a compound, including its chemical structure, its concentration, and the route of exposure.

One approach to solving the TRTD problem is to use a deep learning model. Deep learning models are powerful machine learning models that can learn from large amounts of data. They have been shown to be effective for a variety of tasks, including image classification, natural language processing, and speech recognition.

In this project, we will use a deep learning model to train a model to predict the toxicity of a given chemical compound. We will use the Tox21 dataset, which is a large dataset of chemical compounds and their toxicity data.

The following are the HTML files that we will need for our application:

* `index.html`: This will be the main page of our application. It will contain a form that allows users to enter the SMILES string of a chemical compound.
* `results.html`: This page will display the results of the toxicity prediction.
* `about.html`: This page will provide information about the TRTD problem and our application.

The following are the routes that we will need for our application:

* `/`: This route will render the `index.html` page.
* `/predict`: This route will accept a POST request with the SMILES string of a chemical compound. It will then use the deep learning model to predict the toxicity of the compound and render the `results.html` page.
* `/about`: This route will render the `about.html` page.

The following is a diagram of the architecture of our application:

In this diagram, the user enters the SMILES string of a chemical compound into the form on the `index.html` page. The form submits the SMILES string to the `/predict` route. The `/predict` route uses the deep learning model to predict the toxicity of the compound and then renders the `results.html` page. The `results.html` page displays the results of the toxicity prediction.

The user can also click on the "About" link to learn more about the TRTD problem and our application. The "About" link takes the user to the `/about` route, which renders the `about.html` page.
